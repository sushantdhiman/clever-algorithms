# Clever Algorithms
JavaScript implementation of the Clever Algorithms from http://www.cleveralgorithms.com

Clever Algorithms are the programming techniques that try to solve problem by approximation or non deterministic techniques. Generally inspired from various fields of AI, Natural Organisms and Computation Theory.

## Inspiration
After finding post about Clever Algorithms - The Book, [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11665878) on HackerNews I thought about implementing these algorithms.

## Tech
We will be using JavaScript Runtime Node.JS , But these implementations will be plain so we can understand the problem rather than diving to JavaScript language itself.

## Structure
Algorithms will be structured in same way as they are in the book itself.
